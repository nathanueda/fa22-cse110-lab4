1. The bug is that num1 and num2 are of type string and therefore upon adding these two together, we are concatenating two strings together rather than summing to integers.
2. To fix it, I appliex the unary plus operator in front of num1 and num2 to convert them to a number as this operator converts a string into a floating point number when placed before the string.
